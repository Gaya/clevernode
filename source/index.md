> (Full stack) **Web Developer**. Specialising in **JavaScript**, **React**, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern front-end. I create **rich applications** for the Internet and mobile platforms. Both in the front-end and in the back-end. 

I am **Gaya Kessler**, a developer living in the Netherlands. Opinionated, always ready for a discussion, and to help build something great.

My passion is to create the best for the web, always keeping up with the latest in web technologies. This allowed me to work on a lot of different projects, and thus experience what works and what doesn't in various different situations.

**I create simple solutions to complex problems.**

## What I am Good at

Subjects I mainly focus on are **JavaScript** (and TypeScript), back-end JavaScript using **Node.js**, front-end development, **React**, Redux, **WebPack**, **Single Page Applications** / Progressive Web Apps, and mobile apps (**React Native**).

I love to work in **agile environments**, both on site and with **remote teams**.

My main value I provide is that I can take a **complex subject** and turn it into something **understandable**. This way even beginning programmers can follow what the complex parts of the product are doing.

## Professional Experience

I have been working in web development professionally from 2006. Since then, I've seen a lot of trends come and go, which has formed a solid opinion on what works, and what doesn't.

I also occasionally speak at meetups, conferences, and in-company about these topics.

In the past I have worked on projects of various sizes. This helped me in choosing the right tool for the job. From **small JavaScript widgets** to **full-blown applications**; anything is possible.
