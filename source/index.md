> (Full stack) **Web Developer**. I create **rich applications** for the Internet and mobile platforms. Both in the front-end and in the back-end. Specialised in **JavaScript**, **React**, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern front-end.

My name is **Gaya Kessler**, a developer living in the Netherlands. Opinionated, always ready for a discussion, and to help build something great.

My passion is to create _the best for the web_, always keeping up with the latest technologies and trends. This allows me to work on projects with different perspectives, and thus know what works and what doesn't.

**I create simple solutions to complex problems.**

## What I am Good at

My main value I provide is that I can take a **complex subject** and turn it into something **understandable**. This way even starting programmers can follow what the complex parts of your product are doing.

I love **sharing my knowledge** and like to **teach and mentor developers** while I work on projects. This way the team I am working with will get a bit of my experience transferred to them.

My believe is that I **bring more value** to the product if I teach my ways to the current development team.

My work is at its best in **agile environments**, and with **remote teams**. On site is also possible.

## Technologies I Excel at

Subjects I mainly focus on are **JavaScript** (and TypeScript), back-end JavaScript using **Node.js**, front-end development, **React**, Redux, **WebPack**, **Single Page Applications** / Progressive Web Apps, and mobile apps (**React Native**).

## Professional Experience

I have been working in web development professionally from 2006. Since then, I've seen a lot of trends come and go, which has formed a solid opinion on what works, and what doesn't, what sticks, and what doesn't.

I also occasionally **speak at meetups, conferences, and do in-company training** about technology and trends.

In the past I have worked on projects of various sizes. This helped me in choosing the right tool for the job. From **small JavaScript widgets** to **full-blown applications**; anything is possible.
