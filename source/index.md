> (Full stack) **Web Developer**. Specialising in **JavaScript**, **React**, Node.js, and modern front-end. With a background in computer science, I create **rich applications** for the Internet and mobile platforms. Both in the front-end and in the back-end. 

Let me introduce myself, my name is **Gaya Kessler**, a developer living in the Netherlands. Opinionated, always ready for a discussion, and to help build something great.

I am passionate about creating the best for the web, always keeping up with the latest in web technologies. This allowed me to work on a lot of different projects, and thus experience what works and what doesn't in various different situations.

## What I am Good at

Subjects I mainly focus on are **JavaScript**, front-end development, **React**, Redux, **WebPack**, **Single Page Applications**, mobile apps (**React Native**), and back-end JavaScript using **Node.js**.

I love to work in agile environments, both on site and with remote teams.

## Teaching Other Developers

What I **love to do** is to **teach people** all I know about JavaScript, React, Node, remote work, and other subjects.

I can **teach you and your team** about new technologies and the ideas behind them.
Find it hard to get a grip on React and Redux? Don't know how to start using modern JavaScript? I can arrange **a workshop for your needs.**

## Hire me

Hire me for **freelance JavaScript / React development** as well as solving the whole **front-end tool stack of your projects**. My experience lies in creating solid and stable applications which teams of developers like to keep working on and improve.

My strength is that because I have a computer science background, I know how to structure and create the right architectures for complex web applications. I also have an eye for code quality and following best-practises.

## Experience

I have been working in web development professionally from 2006. Since then I've seen a lot of trends come and go, which has formed a solid opinion on what works, and what doesn't.

In the past I have worked on projects of various sizes. This helped me in choosing the right tool for the job. From **small JavaScript widgets** to **full blown applications**; anything is possible.
