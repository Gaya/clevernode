> I create **web applications** for the Internet and mobile platforms. Both in the front-end and in the back-end. Specialised in **JavaScript**, **React**, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern front-end.

My name is **Gaya Kessler**, an independent (full stack) web developer located in the Netherlands. Opinionated, always ready for a discussion, and to help build something great.

My passion is to create _the best for the web_, and to always keep up with the latest technologies and trends.

In a nutshell: **I create simple solutions to complex problems.**

## What I am Good at

The main value I provide is that I can take a **complex subject** and turn it into something **understandable**. This way even starting programmers can follow what the complex parts of your product are doing.

I love **sharing my knowledge** and like to **teach and mentor developers** while I work on projects. This way the team I am working with will get a bit of my experience transferred to them.

My belief is that I **bring more value** to the product if I teach my ways to the current development team.

My work is at its best in **agile environments**, and with **remote teams**. On site is also possible.

## Why Hire me?

Hire me for **freelance JavaScript / React development**. I can solve your whole **front-end of your projects**. My experience lies in creating solid and stable applications which teams of developers like to keep working on and improve.

My strength is that I know how to structure and create the **right architectures for complex web applications**. I also have an eye for code quality and following best-practises.

I also have a background in **backend / web services development**, therefore **I can cover a broad spectrum of needs**. This also makes it a lot easier for me to interact with existing teams.

I help teams create readable solutions and future proof code.

                I often compare trying to find the best developers with finding an amazing drummer for a band. They are the key to success and almost impossible to find. There are so many out there but the good ones have already found success and are usually unavailable. Gaya is that perfect drummer who has been available for me on multiple projects and a key to success. He’s an amazing developer, communicator and innovator and always sees the bigger picture of whatever I’ve thrown his way. I’ve worked with a large amount of people over my career and Gaya is on the top of my list!

## Professional Experience

I have been working in web development professionally from 2006. Since then, I've seen a lot of trends come and go, which has formed a solid opinion on what works, and what doesn't, what sticks, and what doesn't.

I also occasionally **speak at meetups, conferences, and do in-company training** about technology and trends.

In the past I have worked on projects of various sizes. This helped me in choosing the right tool for the job. From **small JavaScript widgets** to **full-blown applications**; anything is possible.
