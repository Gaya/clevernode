> Front-end development is a **fast moving landscape**, especially if you're involved with technologies like **JavaScript**. It can be hard to align the vision of the designer and technical implementations of the backend. This is where I come in.

With **over 15 years of experience** creating for the web, on various platforms, I've built a solid foundation for utilising **best practises** in different difficult situations.

Let me advise you how your frontend should look like and function. Because usability is just as important for your product's success as the looks.

## Front-end Done Right

There is a **big difference in quality of work** delivered by frontend developers. While skills and results might look the same, the outcome and feeling of the products varies quite a lot.

Because of my technical background I am able to help bring the implementation of your applications to a higher level.

**Reduce bugs**, reduce developer churn, create a **better and trusted environment you can work in**.

## Streamlined Product Development

I have a ton of experience being the communication hub between design and technical implementation. Because I have successfully operated in-between these two disciples, I can safely say I know what is needed to get the product to the best outcome possible.

Having had the pleasure to operate in **various forms of agile** development teams, I can guide a team to a better workflow and **get things done**.

## Getting it Done

Trouble finishing your products, or trouble launching new features? I'll get it done.

One of my strengths is that I can see what it really needed to **move forward and get the job done** without losing any of the quality.
