> Are you looking for an **experienced React Developer**? Look no further. I've been doing React since 2015, and JavaScript since 2007.

React is a very popular framework for building **web applications**, statically generated websites, mobile apps, and working with **headless CMS', blogs, or e-commerce**.

**I have a ton of experience with the framework** and can help you with the problem at hand.

## Why React?

React works in such a way that it forces the developer to think about the structure and communication from the same perspective. Whereas other frameworks allow for different solutions, React tries to keep every developer heading the same way, while also using **regular JavaScript without any magic**!

Another great aspect is the React is just a way to represent your data and how to communicate changes within said data, the rest is up to the developer to choose.

Popularity of React is rapidly growing, and more and more developers are getting into it. **It's a great investment into the future.**
