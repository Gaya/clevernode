# Gaya Kessler Uses

This page lists the tools I use to do my job. Based on examples by other people doing the same over at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

# Editor / IDE and Terminal

- I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as my main IDE
- My colour scheme of choice is _One Dark Vivid_
- My code font is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- As my terminal I use _Terminal.app_ default to macOS
- My shell is [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with a variation of the "cloud" theme

# Other computer stuff

- My operating system is _macOS_. If I have to use a PC I tend to go for a lightweight Linux distro
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com) is my browser of choice, both for development and regular browsing
- I keep my passwords and other secrets safe using [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org/), a port of KeePass. Though I must say I like the new passwords app on MacOS too.
