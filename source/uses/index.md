# Gaya Kessler Uses

This page lists the tools I use to do my job. Based on examples by other people doing the same over at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

# Editor / IDE and Terminal

- I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as my main IDE
- My colour scheme of choice is _One Dark Vivid_
- My code font is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- As my terminal I use _Terminal.app_ default to macOS
- My shell is [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with a variation of the "cloud" theme

# Other computer stuff

- My operating system is _macOS_. If I have to use a PC I tend to go for a lightweight Linux distro
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com) is my browser of choice, both for development and regular browsing
- I keep my passwords and other secrets safe using [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org/), a port of KeePass

# On my desk
- _MacBook M1 Pro 14-inch 2021_ is my current workstation
- Recently switched to a sit / stand desk and loving it!
- I use *just* one monitor: _LG 27UP850 - 4K IPS USB-C_
- My keyboard is a _Keychron K8_
- _Magic Trackpad 2 - Space Grey_ instead of a mouse. Best choice ever.
- I have two old school _Philips FB750 speakers_ for my listening pleasure
