# Gaya Kessler Uses

This page lists the tools I use to do my job. Based on examples by other people doing the same over at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

# Editor / IDE and Terminal

- I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as my main IDE
- With [Material Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui) for a cleaner look
- My colour scheme of choice is _Material Theme Oceanic_
- My code font is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- As my terminal I use _Terminal.app_ default to MacOS
- My shell is [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with a variation of the "cloud" theme

# Other computer stuff

- My operating system is _MacOS_. If I have to use a PC I tend to go for a lightweight Linux distro
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com) is my browser of choice, both for development and regular browsing
- I keep my passwords and other secrets safe using [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org/), a port of KeePass

# On my desk
- _MacBook Pro mid-2015_ is my current workstation
- I use *just* one monitor: _LG 27UD58 4K Display_
- My keyboard is a [Keychron K3 Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) - White Backlight - Red switches
- _Magic Trackpad 2 - Space Grey_ instead of a mouse. Best choice ever.
- I have two old school _Philips FB750 speakers_ for my listening pleasure
- Which needs an amp, mine is a very small one: [Fosi Audio mini power amp](https://fosiaudio.com/collections/2-channel-amplifier/products/tda7498e-2-channel-stereo-audio-amplifier-receiver-mini-hi-fi-class-d-integrated-amp-home-speakers-160w-x-2-power-supply)
