# About Gaya Kessler

> I am a freelance web developer specialising in JavaScript, living in Deurne, a small town in the south of The Netherlands, close to Eindhoven.

I've been a developer professionally for over 14 years. That's almost half of the time I've been alive!

Since I was young **I always had an interest in creating things** on the computer. This varied from creating video games, drawing, making music, creating websites, and eventually programming.

Because I had the possibility to learn computer science during my time at high school I got a taste of what it could be to do this as a living. I couldn't believe **something this much fun could actually become a job** I got paid for. 

From my room in my parents' attic and a slow internet connection I started learning how to write websites from scratch and program the back-end systems supporting it.

I later went to university to get a degree in Computer Science. Around the same time I got a part-time job at a [local web development company](https://cybox.nl), where I learned a lot more than at school. I'll be forever thankful for the opportunity I got working there.

Because I was learning so much, I decided it was a good idea to [write down what I was learning](https://gaya.pizza) about. To this day I still write on my weblog from time to time. It helps me collect my thoughts and share them with the world.

I've worked at good, and less nice companies through the years. This allowed me to _not only_ grow from a _technical perspective_, but also _personally_. In my experience I've grown the most by working at such a variety of different companies and projects. This also allowed me to know what I am good at, and which environments suit me best. 

Through the years I always focused my work around learning and challenging myself. I love sharing this knowledge and have spoken at various meetups and conferences about it. Sharing knowledge and helping people improve their skills is something I get the most satisfaction out off.

One of the things I seem to like the best was _JavaScript_ and making a web page interactive. I tried to do as much work with JavaScript and tried to utilise it for project at jobs I had.

For the sake practising and learning more **I started a lot of side-projects**. Such as [Drammit](https://dramm.it) where I wanted to create my own app. This project saw a few iterations where I learned a lot of new techniques which I then applied to my day to day job.

After ten years of working at companies, I thought it was time to move on and work **freelance**. This has allowed me to work for awesome companies like [Philips](https://philips.com), [Route42](https://route42.nl), [BrewPi](https://brewpi.com), and [Dekode](https://dekode.no).

Apart from development and programming I like to take enough time off to enjoy life away from the desk.

I am an active **runner**, which helps me both physically and mentally. 

I love to **cook** for me and my wife, or friends. 

You can find me at **loud music** concerts drinking a beer and banging my head. 

I enjoy a good **glass of whisky** (or whiskey) with good company. 

I believe in a **sustainable lifestyle** to better the future of the planet, and humanity as a whole.
