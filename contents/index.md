>(Full stack) **Web Development**. Specialized in **JavaScript**, Sass & Modern Front-end
Development. Standing in the eye of the storm **breathing harmony** into back-end, front-end &
design.

My name is Gaya Kessler, a developer living in the Netherlands. Opinionated and always ready for a
discussion or to help build something great. Also creator of the
[Social Whisky app Drammit](https://dramm.it).

I am passionate about creating the best of the best, always keeping up with the latest in web
technologies. This enabled me to work on a lot of different projects and experience what works in
different situations.

Specialities
------------

The subjects I mainly focus on are **JavaScript** development, front-end, **React**, Redux,
**webpack**, **single page applications**, mobile apps and back-end JavaScript using **Node.js**.

I am available as a **React Developer** as well as solving the whole build pipeline of your projects.
My experience lies in creating solid and stable applications which developers like to keep working
on and improve.

In my past I have worked on various projects of different sizes. This helped me in choosing the
right tool for the job. From small JavaScript widgets to full blown single page applications;
everything is possible.

Need help transitioning to modern front-end workflows?
------------------------------------------------------

If you're project relies on technologies like **grunt**, **require.js**, and other tools which have
better alternatives, it might be hard to know where to start your transition.

I have experience upgrading pipelines of projects to **webpack**, **ES6 using Babel**, and minimize
the amount of plugins and tools a project needs in order to run.

Steps toward a better environment are hard, and having an extra, experienced, eye can help a lot. I
can help you **solve this problem**. The solution might be closer than you'd expect.
