        (Full stack) <strong>Web Development</strong>. Specialized in <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
        Sass & Modern Front-end Development. Standing in the eye of the storm <strong>breathing
        harmony</strong> into back-end, front-end & design.

    <p>
        My name is Gaya Kessler, a developer living in the Netherlands. Opinionated and always ready
        for a discussion or to help build something great. Also creator of the
        <a href="https://dramm.it">Social Whisky app Drammit</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am passionate about creating the best of the best, always keeping up with the latest in
        web technologies. This enabled me to work on a lot of different projects and experience what
        works in different situations.
    </p>

    <h2>Specialities</h2>

    <p>
        The subjects I mainly focus on are <strong>JavaScript</strong> development, front-end,
        <strong>React</strong>, Redux, <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>single page
        applications</strong>, mobile apps and back-end JavaScript using <strong>Node.js</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am available as a <strong>React Developer</strong> as well as solving the whole build
        pipeline of your projects. My experience lies in creating solid and stable applications
        which developers like to keep working on and improve.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the past I have worked on various projects of different sizes. This helped me in choosing
        the right tool for the job. From small JavaScript widgets to full blown single page
        applications; everything is possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Need help transitioning to modern front-end workflows?</h2>

    <p>
        If your project relies on technologies like <strong>grunt</strong>,
        <strong>require.js</strong>, and other tools which have better alternatives, it might be
        hard to know where to start your transition. Replacements can be hard to find.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have experience upgrading pipelines of projects to <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>ES6
        using Babel</strong>, and minimize the amount of plugins and tools a project needs in order
        to run.
    </p>

    <p>
        Steps toward a better environment are hard, and having an extra, experienced, eye can help a
        lot. I can help you <strong>solve this problem</strong>. The solution might be closer than
        you'd expect.
