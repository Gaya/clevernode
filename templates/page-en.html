<p>
    Let me introduce myself, my name is Gaya Kessler, a developer living in the Netherlands.
    Opinionated, always ready for a discussion, and to help build something great. Also creator
    of the <a href="https://dramm.it">Social Whisky app Drammit</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I am passionate about creating the best for the web, always keeping up with the latest in
    web technologies. This enabled me to work on a lot of different projects and experience what
    works in different situations.
</p>

<h2>Specialities</h2>

<p>
    Subjects I mainly focus on are <strong>JavaScript</strong>, front-end development,
    <strong>React</strong>, Redux, <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>single page
    applications</strong>, mobile apps and back-end JavaScript using <strong>Node.js</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Available for hire</h2>

    In the past I have worked on projects of various sizes. This helped me in choosing the right
    tool for the job. From <strong>small JavaScript widgets</strong> to <strong>full blown

<h2>Need help transitioning to modern front-end workflows?</h2>

<p>
    If your project relies on technologies like <strong>grunt</strong>,
    <strong>require.js</strong>, and other tools which now have better alternatives, it might be
    hard to know where to start your transition. The right replacements and the way to them can
    be quite challenging.
</p>

<p>
    I have experience upgrading pipelines of projects to <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>ES6
    using Babel</strong>, and minimise the amount of plugins and tools a project needs in order
    to run. It doesn't matter if you're stuck with grunt, gulp, or require.js, there is a
    solution.
</p>

<p>
    Steps toward a better environment are hard. Having an extra, experienced, eye can help a lot. I
    can help you <strong>solve this problem</strong>.
